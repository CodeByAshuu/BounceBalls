# BounceBall

A lightweight, interactive 2D physics playground simulating bouncing balls using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.  

This project demonstrates fundamental physics concepts like gravity, collision, and restitution (bounciness) with smooth performance and responsive design. Perfect for learning, teaching, or showcasing simple physics simulations on the web.

## Features

- Realistic 2D ball physics with gravity and elastic collisions  
- Interactive: click or tap to spawn new balls anywhere on the canvas  
- Adjustable gravity and restitution using sliders  
- Drag and move balls with the mouse or touch input  
- Responsive layout that works well on desktop and mobile screens  
- Lightweight and no external dependencies â€” pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS

## Usage

- Click or tap inside the canvas to add a new ball at that position.  
- Drag balls around with mouse or touch.  
- Use the sliders to adjust gravity and bounciness dynamically.  
- Use the buttons to add random balls, clear all balls, or pause/resume the simulation.
